I can safely say one of the most impacting things I learned that made me a better trader was order flow, specifically learning to read the tape or time and sales. In this course, I will teach you how to read the tape/time and sales. I will bring my more than 15 years of trading experience to the table to give you a very in depth look into the tools, knowledge and nuisances to reading the time and sales. It will be the best decision you ever made in your trading career. I like to think trading isn't difficult. It is largely a battle with ourselves. The fight with your own reptilian brain. It is because of this I have created all the courses on Udemy to help you defeat yourself with the most accurate knowledge possible. It's the best I can do. In this course you will learn How to read a time and sales Identifying order types on the tape and their impact Develop trading techniques based on your tape reading knowledge How to identify support and resistance on the Tape And much more....

One of the earliest memories I can remember is me building imaginary machines with big building blocks in the kindergarten I was attending. My interest grew with me. This is the reason why I\u00a0choose to study Electrical and Electronics Engineering in my Bachalor's degree. Later on, I\u00a0focused mainly on Computer Vision applications during my Master's degree. During my studies I published 4 papers and graduated with a very good GPA. Right after my studies, I started to work as a Machine Learning Engineer. Since then, I have worked on many different Computer Vision, NLP, and audio processing applications which have been used by many people. I have experience both in academia as a Machine Learning Researcher, and in industry as a Machine Learning Engineer. Therefore I know how to combine theory and practice in a well suited way. One of the biggest issues I had in my studies was that most of the instructors just didn't care enough about the lectures, and they didn't care about whether or not the students were getting what they were talking about. I\u00a0suffered from that a lot, and my intention is to make my courses as clear and detailed as possible, and my goal is to make everyone truly understand the content of my lectures.

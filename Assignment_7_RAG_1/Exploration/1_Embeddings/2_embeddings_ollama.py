"""
- This script generates an embedding vector for a given sentence using the Ollama API with the 'nomic-embed-text' model.
- It performs the following steps:
    - Defines a sample sentence to embed.
    - Sends a POST request to the local Ollama server to obtain the embedding.
    - Converts the received embedding to a NumPy array.
    - Prints the length and first five values of the resulting embedding vector.
- Useful for testing and demonstrating how to obtain text embeddings from a locally running Ollama model.
